# CiteTrack v1.1.1 - Copy-Paste Bug Fix 🐛

## 🐛 Bug Fix Release

This is a focused bug fix release that addresses the copy-paste functionality issue in the "Add Scholar" dialog.

### 🔧 Fixed Issues

#### Copy-Paste Functionality Restored
- **Problem**: Users could not use keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+A, etc.) in the "Add Scholar" dialog input fields
- **Solution**: Implemented custom `EditableTextField` class with full keyboard shortcut support
- **Impact**: All standard text editing shortcuts now work properly in scholar addition dialogs

### ✨ What's Fixed

- ✅ **Cmd+A (Select All)**: Now properly selects all text in input fields
- ✅ **Cmd+C (Copy)**: Copy selected text to clipboard
- ✅ **Cmd+V (Paste)**: Paste text from clipboard
- ✅ **Cmd+X (Cut)**: Cut selected text to clipboard
- ✅ **Cmd+Z (Undo)**: Undo last text operation
- ✅ **Cmd+Shift+Z (Redo)**: Redo text operation
- ✅ **Cross-Application Copy-Paste**: Copy text from other apps and paste into CiteTrack

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### Enhanced Text Input System
- **New EditableTextField Class**: Custom NSTextField subclass that properly handles keyboard events
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: Overrides `performKeyEquivalent` to process standard text editing shortcuts
- **Proper Focus Management**: Sets initial focus to the first input field when dialog opens
- **Text Field Properties**: Configured with proper editing, selection, and scrolling properties

#### Improved User Experience
- **Immediate Focus**: Dialog opens with cursor ready in the Scholar ID field
- **Seamless Workflow**: Users can now copy Scholar IDs from web browsers and paste directly
- **Standard Behavior**: All text editing behaves exactly like native macOS text fields

### 📊 Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `Sources/SettingsWindow.swift`
- **New Class**: `EditableTextField` with keyboard shortcut support
- **Lines Added**: ~35 lines of code for robust text editing
